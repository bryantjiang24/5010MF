Apply Arbitraging in the market

When we talk about arbitrage, we can’t help to mention Warren Buffett, one of the most
successful investors in the world. He saw profit-generating opportunities in arbitrage at the age
of six. He would buy 6 cans of Coca-Cola for 25 cents and sell them nearby for 5 cents, making a
profit of 5 cents per can. He found that he could profit from the difference between the price of a
six-pack of beer and what people were willing to pay for a bottle of beer. This is a typical
example of arbitrage. Actually, arbitrage includes many types and methods, but its essence is to
use information differences to make profits. There are several common kinds of arbitrage in the
market, including time arbitrage, index arbitrage, spatial arbitrage, and inward arbitrage.

Time arbitrage is an opportunity created when a stock misses its mark and is sold based
on a short-term outlook with little change in the long-term prospects of the company. It may
occur when there are rumors spreading or news headlines propagating that affect the price
immediately. Investors like Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch have used time arbitrage to increase
their chances of outperforming the market. The index arbitrage makes profits when there are
differences in the index between two markets. Where the price difference originates, the index
arbitrage occurs. It can keep markets’ prices synchronized in all the trading sessions. The spatial
arbitrage happens when there is a price difference between two places. The arbitrageur can buy
an asset from an area and sell it at a different place at a higher price. The inward arbitrage occurs
when there is a difference in interest rate between two banks or financial institutions. One can
borrow money from the interbank market and then deposit it somewhere at a higher interest rate.

In this project, we will further explore arbitrage opportunities in real estate, forex, sports
betting, cryptocurrency, and the stock market.
